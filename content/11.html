<h1> Impact of domestic gardens on nature </h1><br />
     Domestic gardens have a profound impact on nature and the environment around us. They can be used to produce food and provide shelter for animals and insects, as well as create an oasis of color and life in otherwise urban spaces. However, it is important to remember that our gardens are still part of the natural world and need to be managed responsibly to ensure a healthy balance.<br />
<br />
I will be exploring the impact of domestic gardens on nature, looking at the ways they can be used to benefit both wildlife and people. We will look at the positive and negative effects of gardening, from the benefits of providing food and shelter for animals to the potential damage caused by introducing invasive species. We will also look at how to make gardens more wildlife-friendly, using native plants and creating more diverse habitats. Finally, I will discuss the importance of sustainable gardening practices, such as composting and using natural methods of pest control, to ensure our gardens are not only beautiful but also beneficial for the environment.</body>
